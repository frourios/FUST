\chapter{Coefficients and Elimination Patterns of Each Operator}
\label{app:coefficients}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Operator & Points & Coefficients & Coeff. sum & Eliminated $K_n$ \\
\hline
$D_2$ & $\{\varphi, \psi\}$ & $[1, -1]$ & $0$ & $\{0\}$ \\
$D_3$ & $\{\varphi, 1, \psi\}$ & $[1, -2, 1]$ & $0$ & $\{0\}$ \\
$D_4$ & $\{\varphi^2, \varphi, \psi, \psi^2\}$ & $[1, -\varphi^2, \psi^2, -1]$ & $-\sqrt{5}$ & $\{2\}$ \\
$D_5$ & $\{\varphi^2, \varphi, 1, \psi, \psi^2\}$ & $[1, 1, -4, 1, 1]$ & $0$ & $\{0, 1\}$ \\
$D_{5.5}$ & $D_5 + \mu \Delta_2$ & Mixed & $0$ & Mixed \\
$D_6$ & $\{\varphi^3, \varphi^2, \varphi, \psi, \psi^2, \psi^3\}$ & $[1, -3, 1, -1, 3, -1]$ & $0$ & $\{0, 1, 2\}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Note}: Only $D_4$ has non-zero coefficient sum (gauge breaking). Only $D_6$ eliminates $x^0, x^1, x^2$ simultaneously. $D_{5.5}$ is a mixture of $D_5$ (symmetric) and $\Delta_2$ (antisymmetric difference).

\chapter{Neutrality with Respect to the Axiom of Choice}
\label{app:ac_neutrality}

FUST is \textbf{neutral} with respect to the full Axiom of Choice (AC). That is, the core structures of FUST are constructible within ZF + DC (Dependent Choice) and do not depend on whether full AC holds.

\section{Constructibility within ZF + DC}

\begin{theorem}[Constructibility within ZF + DC]
\label{thm:zf_dc_constructible}
The core structures of FUST (difference operators $D_n$, kernels $\ker(D_n)$, gauge groups) are constructible within the ZF + DC axiom system.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We show that each of the following constructions does not require AC:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Golden ratio $\varphi, \psi$}: Roots of $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$ as algebraic numbers. Constructively definable.

\item \textbf{Coefficients of difference operators $D_n$}: Finite tuples of real numbers. Defined by explicit construction.

\item \textbf{Structure of kernels $\ker(D_n)$}: $\ker(D_5)$ and $\ker(D_6)$ are 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional \textbf{finite-dimensional} vector spaces respectively. For finite-dimensional spaces, existence of bases, orthogonal complements, and spectral decomposition do not require AC.

\item \textbf{Identification of gauge groups}: SU(2), SU(3), U(1) are concretely constructible as finite-dimensional Lie groups.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\section{AC Neutrality}

\begin{corollary}[AC Neutrality]
FUST is neutral with respect to AC. That is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Full AC cannot be derived from ZF + DC + FUST
\item ZF + DC + $\neg$AC + FUST is also consistent (if ZF + DC + $\neg$AC is consistent)
\end{itemize}
\end{corollary}

\section{Analysis of Where Infinity Appears}

Places where infinity appears in FUST:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Construction & Type of infinity & AC dependence \\
\hline
Frourio exponential $\exp_{\mathsf{F}}(x)$ & Infinite series & Not required (explicit construction) \\
Mellin transform & Integral & Not required (Lebesgue integral) \\
``For any $n \geq 7$'' & Countable infinity & Not required (concrete for each $n$) \\
Completeness of function spaces & Limits & DC suffices \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Note}: The Axiom of Dependent Choice (DC) is weaker than AC and suffices for ordinary analysis. FUST operates completely within ZF + DC.

\section{Physical Selection Principles and Mathematical Axiom of Choice}

Relationship between FUST's claim of ``no need for selection principles'' and AC:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Concept & Content \\
\hline
\textbf{Physical selection principle} & Principles explaining ``why this universe'' (anthropic principle, etc.) \\
\textbf{Mathematical Axiom of Choice} & Existence of choice function from families of non-empty sets \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

FUST derives physical laws \textbf{without physical selection principles}. This is consistent with \textbf{not using the mathematical Axiom of Choice}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Both avoid ``choice''
\item FUST's structures are defined by concrete constructions, not requiring abstract choices
\end{itemize}

\section{Significance}

AC neutrality is evidence that FUST is constructed without assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Robustness of foundations}: FUST holds regardless of whether AC is true
\item \textbf{Constructive nature}: Core structures are concretely constructible
\end{enumerate}
