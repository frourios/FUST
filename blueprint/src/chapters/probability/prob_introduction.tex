% FUST Probability Theory Introduction

\chapter{FUST Probability Theory}
\label{chap:probability}

This chapter presents probability theory derived structurally from the
$D_6$ operator, without external probability axioms or measure theory
assumptions.

\section{Overview}

The key insight is that probability emerges from:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\varphi$-scale iteration generating observation sequences
\item Empirical distribution from frequency counts
\item Born rule as a structural consequence of $D_6$ action
\end{enumerate}

\section{Key Results}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Theorem 3.1}: Same-degree ratio is gauge-invariant
\item \textbf{$\varphi$-scale iteration}: Generates observation sequences
\item \textbf{Empirical distribution}: Frequency-based probability
\item \textbf{Born rule}: Structural consequence of $D_6$ action
\end{enumerate}
